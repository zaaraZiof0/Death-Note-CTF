# 🕯️ Death-Note CTF — The Reaper’s Web

**Category:** Digital Forensics / Reverse Engineering  
**Difficulty:** Easy

## Challenge Story

The Grim Reaper has left behind more than just fear — he has crafted a silent Android application.  
At first glance, it appears harmless… just a shrine webpage dedicated to Death itself.

But appearances deceive.

Hidden deep within the APK are secrets he never intended mortals to find.  
Your task is to perform a **complete static analysis** of this application. Extract it. Pick it apart. Study everything.

Two hidden fragments are buried within:

1️⃣ **A Secret Path** — concealed in the application’s data files  
2️⃣ **A Password** — encoded within the source code  

Only when these two are discovered and combined will the Reaper reveal his final message.

**Do you have what it takes to outwit Death?**
